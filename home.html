          Peyton Oshima began karting in 2013 at the age of 8, competing at club level in Japan.
          After proving his talent in karting, he transitioned to single-seaters in 2020 at 15, quickly
          making a name for himself in junior formula. His breakthrough came in 2022 when he claimed
          the FIA Formula 3 title, followed by a strong FIA Formula 2 campaign in 2023. As a result,
          he was inducted into the Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy.
        </p>
        <p>
          After serving as Scuderia Ferrariâ€™s reserve driver in 2024, Peyton will step up as a full-time
          Ferrari Formula 1 driver for 2025.
